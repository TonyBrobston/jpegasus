## Commands

 Comment on Issue or Pull Request, asking @all-contributors to add a contributor:

```
@all-contributors please add <username> for <contributions>
```
See the [Emoji Key (Contribution Types Reference)](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for a list of valid `contribution` types.

The bot will then create a Pull Request to add the contributor, then reply with the pull request details.

> Your request to the bot doesn't need to be perfect. The bot will use [basic Natural Language Parsing](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors-bot/blob/master/src/tasks/processIssueComment/utils/parse-comment/index.js) to determine your intent.
> For example, this will work too:
>
> `Jane you are crushing it in documentation and your infrastructure work has been great too. Let's add jane.doe23 for her contributions. cc @all-contributors`
